# Hack-Indore-2.0
Problem Statement - 07 ("Interest Recogniser")

Solution - 

The solution we are providing for it use pyhton as programming language. Dataset used in this problem was built by our team based on the required of the soultion. Dataset have around 104 rows and 3 columns. 

In this project we identified the best possible friends of a user based on his interests (Hobbies). Python has library called sklearn which is very helpful in categorising the text based on your requirement and we can manipulate this data using in combination other library called pandas. 

Following python library were also used -
 
 1.Sklearn - Scikit-learn (formerly sklearn) is a machine learning library for the Python programming language.[3] It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector etc.
 
 2.Pandas - This is used to manipulate the data
 
 3.Matplotlib - This is used to plot the graph based on data provided by scilearn function used for comparing and recognising the  text that is used as feature obtained from dataset.
 
 Software used where:
 
 * Sypder
 * Excel
